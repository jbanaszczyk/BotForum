You: What is capital of Poland

[deepseek-r1:1.5b]: Poland does not have a formal capital city as its own state has no officially recognized capital. Instead, it is governed by the Polish government and handles administrative tasks across various regions. The largest cities in Poland are Cracow (known as "The City of Slurs") and Krakow (also referred to as the same name), both of which have significant historical and cultural importance within the country. Warsaw, however, is associated with history but isn't classified as the capital of Poland. Therefore, if the user refers to a regional or local city, Cracow and Krakow are the primary cities often highlighted in such contexts.

**Answer:** Poland does not have a formal capital. However, the largest cities are Cracow (known as "The City of Slurs") and Krakow (also referred to as the same name). Warsaw is associated with history but isn't classified as the capital.
