You: What is capital of SanEscobar?

[deepseek-r1:14b]: The term "SanEscobar" does not correspond to any known country or officially recognized location. If you meant a specific place or have additional context, please provide further details so I can assist you better!

[gemma3:4b]: San Escobar does not have a formally recognized capital city. It is a micronation, a self-declared independent state, and its seat of government is located in the town of **San Vicente**, within the municipality of El Chocó, Colombia.

[SpeakLeash/bielik-11b-v2.3-instruct:Q4_K_M]: SanEscobar is a fictional country created by Spanish comedians as part of a satirical news report in 2016. The capital city mentioned in the report was "San Escobar City." However, since SanEscobar is not a real country, it does not have an official capital or any political, geographical, or infrastructure elements associated with a real nation. It is important to note that this entire concept is purely for humor and has no basis in reality.

[qwen3:14b]: SanEscobar is not recognized as a country, region, or municipality in any official geographic or political context. It may be a fictional name, a misspelling, or a reference to a non-existent location. If you meant a different name or have additional context, please clarify, and I’ll do my best to assist.

[phi4:latest]: As of my last update in October 2023, there is no recognized country or region officially named "SanEscobar." It's possible that this could be a fictional place, a nickname, or an unofficial term for a location. If you're referring to a specific area or context where this name might apply (such as literature, media, or local usage), additional details would help clarify the question.

If you are looking for information on any other known country or region named with "San" (often used in Spanish-speaking countries) and possibly involving "Escobar" (a surname associated with several places and individuals), please provide more context. In cases like Colombia, Medellín was historically significant due to Pablo Escobar's association with the city.

For accurate and up-to-date information, consulting a reliable geographic or governmental source would be advisable.
