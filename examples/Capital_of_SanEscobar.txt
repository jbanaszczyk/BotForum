You: What is capital of SanEscobar?

[deepseek-r1:1.5b]: Without additional context, it's unclear which city you're referring to by "SanEscobar." If it's a typo for something else (e.g., SanEspido in some Spanish-speaking countries), I'd need more details to provide an accurate answer. Could you clarify or provide additional information?

[gemma3:1b]: The capital of Escobar is **Escobar**, Colombia!

Itâ€™s a vibrant and bustling city known for its stunning landscapes, particularly its waterfalls and the impressive Escobar Waterfall. ðŸ˜Š

Is there anything specific youâ€™d like to know about Escobar?

[SpeakLeash/bielik-11b-v2.3-instruct:Q4_K_M]: San Escobar is a fictional island nation created as a joke in 2016 by then-President-elect Donald Trump during an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The "capital" of San Escobar is also fictitious and has been variously reported as being in the island nation, but there is no official or recognized capital city in reality.

[qwen3:0.6b]: The capital of San Escobar is **San Escobar** itself. It serves as the political and administrative center of the region.

[phi4:latest]: SanEscobar appears to be a fictional or non-existent place, as it does not correspond with any known country, city, or region in reality. If you meant something else or if this name refers to a specific context (such as a work of fiction), please provide more details so I can assist you further. If you have questions about real-world capitals or related topics, feel free to ask!
