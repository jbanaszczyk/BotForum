You: What is capital of Poland?

[deepseek-r1:14b]: The capital of Poland is Warsaw, known in Polish as "Warszawa." It serves as the country's political, economic, and cultural hub, with significant historical landmarks and government institutions located there.

[gemma3:4b]: Okay, let's dive into the details of the capital of Poland – Warsaw! It’s a city with a truly remarkable and complex history, making it far more than just a capital. Here's a comprehensive look at Warsaw:

**1. Officially Recognized Capital:**

* **Since 1990:** Warsaw officially became the capital of the independent Republic of Poland after the fall of communism in 1989. Before that, it was the capital of the Polish People’s Republic (established in 1949).

**2. A City Rebuilt – A Powerful Story:**

* **The Warsaw Uprising (1943):** This is arguably the most defining element of Warsaw's history and its current character. During World War II, the Polish resistance movement, the Home Army, launched a heroic but ultimately unsuccessful uprising against the Nazi occupation. The Germans responded with brutal retribution.
* **Near Total Destruction:** The Germans systematically razed the city to the ground in a scorched-earth policy to prevent its recapture. Almost the entire city was reduced to rubble, with a loss of approximately 85% of its buildings.
* **The "Warsaw Rising" Reconstruction:**  In the immediate post-war years (1944-1954), an astonishing undertaking began: the rebuilding of Warsaw. It was one of the largest reconstruction projects in history, driven by a combination of:
    * **Soviet Support:** The Soviet Union provided significant material and technical assistance.
    * **Polish Determination:**  Millions of ordinary Poles, driven by a powerful desire to rebuild their nation and honor the sacrifices of the uprising, participated in the reconstruction effort.
    * **Architectural Style - “Warsaw Style”:** The reconstruction wasn't simply rebuilding with the same materials and designs. Instead, a new architectural style emerged – the “Warsaw Style.” This style blended elements of:
        * **Baroque:** Reflecting the city’s pre-war heritage.
        * **Art Nouveau:**  A popular European style at the time.
        * **Modernism:** Incorporating some contemporary design principles.
        * **Soviet Influences:** Particularly in the use of brick and monumental architecture.

**3. Key Facts & Figures (as of late 2023/early 2024):**

* **Population:** Approximately 1.8 million people (making it the 6th most populous city in the European Union).
* **Area:** 509 square kilometers (196 square miles).
* **Location:** Situated in east-central Poland, on the Vistula River.
* **Climate:** Temperate continental climate – warm summers and cold, snowy winters.
* **Language:** Polish (official language).
* **Currency:** Polish Złoty (PLN).
* **Time Zone:** CET (Central European Time) - UTC+1.

**4. Major Landmarks & Attractions:**

* **Old Town (Stare Miasto):** A UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is the heart of Warsaw, meticulously rebuilt after the war. Key sites include:
    * **Royal Castle:** (reconstructed) - The former residence of Polish kings.
    * **Market Square (Rynek Starego Miasta):** The largest medieval market square in Poland.
    * **St. John’s Archcathedral Basilica:**  A stunning example of Baroque architecture.
